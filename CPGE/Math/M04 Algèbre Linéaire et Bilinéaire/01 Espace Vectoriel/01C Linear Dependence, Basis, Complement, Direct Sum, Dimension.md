title: Linearly Dependent, Linearly Independent
![[截屏2023-03-01 16.44.10.png]]
- A set of vectors that are not **linearly dependent** is called **linearly independent**. That is to say, when expressed in the form, *all of the* $k_i$ is the zero vector.
```

- *Lemma* : If $x_{1},\dots,x_{n}$ span a linear space and $y_{1},\dots,y_{j}$ are linearly independent, then $$j \leq n$$

title: Basis, Finite Dimensional, $dim$
- A *finite* set of vectors which *span* $X$ and are *linearly independent* are called a **basis** of $X$.
- A linear space $X$ is called **finite dimensional** if it has a basis.
- All **bases** for a **finite-dimensional** linear space $X$ contain the same number of vectors, which we denote as : $$\text{dim }X$$
```

- *Lemma* : A linear space $X$ which is spanned by a *finite* set of vectors has a **basis**.
- *Theorem* : Every **linearly indepedent** set of vectors could be complete to a **basis**.

- *Theoreme*: $X$ is a finite-dimensional linear space. $U$ and $V$ two subspaces of $X$, then $$\text{dim }(U+V) = \text{dim}(U) + \text{dim }(V) - \text{dim }(U \cap V)$$
